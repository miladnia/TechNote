# TechNote

**TechNote** — your Markdown notes, beautifully organized.

TechNote is a self-hosted, distraction-free Markdown-based note-taking app built with Flask and React. Lightweight, fast, and customizable — designed for developers who prefer to keep their notes in plain text and under their control.

### Features

- 📂 **Local Files, Your Way** — _Open any folder of Markdown (`.md`) notes directly, no import or sync required._
- 🛡️ **Own Your Notes** — _Files are standard Markdown, stored locally — no vendor lock-in, no surprises._
- 🧭 **Effortless Navigation** — _Browse folders, jump between notes, and navigate through headings with ease._
- 🔍 **Fast Full-Text Search** — _Quickly search across all your notes._
- 🖥️ **Responsive Interface** — _Clean, distraction-free design that works beautifully on desktop and mobile._

## 🚀 Get Started

### Installation

1. Install TechNote via `pipx`:

```sh
pipx install pytechnote
```

2. Set up TechNote to start automatically on login:

```sh
technote autostart enable
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `technote run` to run TechNote directly in your terminal without enabling autostart.


## 🖥️ Usage Tips

Use the **Open Directory** button in the sidebar to open a directory containing your Markdown (`.md`) files. If you don't have one yet, you can create an empty directory (e.g., `~/Documents/notes/tech_notes`) and open it. Once opened, you’ll see an option next to the directory name to create new notes.

## ✨ How It Works

- **Rendering:** TechNote aims to keep everything explicit and transparent. It simply renders your existing Markdown files as HTML documents. No hidden metadata. No extra files. No surprises. You have full control over your content.
- **Caches:** To improve performance, notes are cached as HTML and updated automatically when you edit them.
- **The database:** TechNote uses a lightweight SQLite database to store minimal metadata — such as unique IDs and display names for notes — and the paths to selected directories. Deleting the database will **not** affect your notes.
